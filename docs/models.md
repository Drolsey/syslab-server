# Models

Benchmarked on the production box (RTX 5090, 32 GB VRAM, Ryzen 9950X, 60 GB RAM)
on 2026-09-08, via `scripts/bench_models.py` against Ollama. Numbers are a
relative-sizing reference, not the production figure: vLLM's PagedAttention
manages KV cache more efficiently than Ollama's allocator, so real footprint
under vLLM should be re-measured once a model is chosen for the profile in
Section 13 of the architecture plan.

## Candidates measured

| Model | Params | Quant | VRAM @8k ctx | VRAM @32k ctx | tok/s @8k | tok/s @32k |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| qwen3:32b | 32.8B | Q4_K_M | 21.9 GB | 27.9 GB | 63.9 | 56.3 |
| gemma3:27b | 27.4B | Q4_K_M | 19.1 GB | 20.7 GB | 76.1 | 71.7 |
| qwen3:14b | 14.8B | Q4_K_M | 10.6 GB | 14.5 GB | 136.6 | 110.6 |

Full raw output: `bench_results.json` on the server (not committed — regenerate
with `scripts/bench_models.py` any time).

## Decision: qwen3:32b, 8192 context, pending Step 3.4 confirmation

Chosen over gemma3:27b despite being slower, because Section 14 of the
architecture plan picked the Qwen3 family specifically for tool-calling
strength, which is what the website's agent depends on — a 20% speed
advantage doesn't matter if the model is worse at the one thing the
integration needs. gemma3:27b remains the fallback if qwen3:32b's tool-calling
quality doesn't hold up under a real multi-turn transcript.

Context capped at 8192 rather than the 32768 in the plan's example profile
(Section 13): at 32k context qwen3:32b measured 27.9 GB, which exceeds the
~22 GB chat budget (`--gpu-memory-utilization 0.70`) and leaves nothing for
embeddings, STT or TTS on the same card. At 8192 context it measured 21.9 GB,
which fits the budget.

qwen3:14b stays the documented fallback for concurrency: 14.5 GB even at 32k
context, more than double the tok/s, and much more headroom for multiple
simultaneous users once Step 3's continuous batching is in play.

**Open, blocking Step 3.4:** re-measure the chosen model under vLLM directly
(not Ollama) with a realistic multi-turn tool-calling transcript, per the
plan's own instruction not to trust a benchmark prompt over a real one.

## Currently running (Step 1 smoke test)

`Qwen/Qwen3-8B-AWQ` via `docker compose up -d` (`docker-compose.yml`, `vllm`
service), confirmed to answer `/v1/chat/completions` and to survive a full
reboot via `restart: unless-stopped`. This is not the production model choice
— it is what proved the container and reboot-persistence gate in Step 1.
Swapping to the production model is Step 3.4 work.
